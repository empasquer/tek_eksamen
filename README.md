   ```
4. To stop the containers:

   docker ps
   ```
   *For more Docker Compose commands, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/).*

6. Access your application:
    - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
      *(If you encounter CORS issues, use [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) instead.)*
    - **Backend**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
    - **H2 Database**: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

## **Customizing the Project**

Here are a few steps to make this template your own:

- [ ] Rename the folder to match your project.
- [ ] Refactor the project name, application name, and metadata as needed. 
- [ ] GO TO `compose.yml` and change all environmental variables to your own (‚ö†Ô∏è messes with the test data)
- [ ] In that same file, make sure to comment and uncomment which profile you want to use (details in file)
- [ ] Review and modify the provided data examples in the `data/` directory.
- [ ] Check the `src/configs` folder:
    - `InitDataExample.java`: Examples for populating your database with JPA.
    - `WebConfig.java`: Customize if necessary, but keep a backup copy.

### **Backend: Spring Boot**
- JPA entity examples can be found in the `models/` folder.
- Check `InitDataExample.java` for guidance on working with JPA.

### **Frontend: Vue.js**
- Modify `App.vue` to reflect your data fetching needs using `fetch` or `axios`.
